        <p>I enjoy reading books a lot. My favorite genre is fantasy. Authors can get really creative about their writing and I really enjoy reading about magical lands or mythical creatures and the characters exploring them. Reading has helped me alot. My volcabulary has increased a ton since I started reading a lot. It also helped me with writing and being creative about it. If you aren't enjoying reading, I can 100% guarantee that its the book you're reading. Explore the complete opposite genre! Keep reading until you find a series or genre to really enjoy. Reading has helped me develop and made be smarter.</p>
